# Installation Process:

1. Download apk file from https://psucustos.github.io/custos/
2. Before you can install it on your phone you will need to make sure that third-party apps are allowed on your device.
3. Go to Menu -> Settings -> Security -> & check Unknown Sources to allow your phone to install apps from sources other than the Google Play Store.
4. Rather than check a global setting to allow installation from unknown sources, you'll be prompted to allow your browser or file manager to install APKs the first time you attempt to do so.
