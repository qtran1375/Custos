_____________
First time launching (I unistall it, clear cache, etc):
1. mMap.setOnMarkerClickListener(this); //will crash first time installing it  and make phone vibrate nonstop

Bottom Buttons:
hiding it will not work, cause some android phones have physical buttons which defeats purpose

Nav Bar / Every Fragment:
1. Need to figure out how to fix dealing with fragments if user clicks back button and it goes to map

Events:
1. Need a limit on name & description (using this in xml probably best: android:maxLength="" )
2. Need to link invite guest to Friends database now
3. need to move the xml to cover whole screen due to hiding user buttons
4. user can enter a new line in description which messes with layout

Notification:
1. TODO ALL

Maps:
1. Need a way to find destination

DangerZone:
1. Need to hide Datasnapshot output when clicking on marker ex: (Datasnapshot = { key = zone_name, value =....}
2. Need to validate that user gave a name
3. need to have character limit on name and description (using this in xml probably best: android:maxLength="" )
4. Need to figure out how to delete old markers
5. "if(marker.getSnippet().contains("Danger"))" is crashing app when clicking a marker

Contacts:
1. search bars get smush sometimes

Edit Info:										
1. Clicking top left yellow button will send user to map activity instead of setting page
2. Have save home location and emergency contact save only after they click the 1 save
3. Save button shows loading dialog even though if there were no changes
