_____________
First time launching (I unistall it, clear cache, etc):
1. mMap.setOnMarkerClickListener(this); //will crash first time installing it  and make phone vibrate nonstop

Events:
1. Need to validate that user pick a valid date (Like today is 4/8/2020 and user pick 3/21/2020
2. Need a limit on name
3. Need a limit on description
4. this line is causing a lot of problems (e.g crashes app when creating events, won't let me view events after creating it, won't let me press back on invite guest) (obj.put("invited_users", getInvitedUsers(element.child("invited_users").getValue().toString()));)

Notification:
1. Needs an update in general						NOT STARTED
2. Need a way to accept or reject friend request	NOT STARTED

Maps:
1. Need a way to find destination					NOT STARTED

DangerZone:
1. Need to hide snapshot output when clicking on marker
2. Need to validate that user gave a name
3. Need a light color variant of the dangerzone button when user changes to dark mode
4. Need to figure out how to delete old markers

Contacts:
1. Needs to show who is their current friends		NOT STARTED
2. Search bar gets smush on my screen size 			NOT IMPORTANT

Settings:	
1. Change buttons

User Account:										DONE FOR NOW
1. Clicking top left yellow button will send user to map activity instead of setting page
2. Changing home location will save before actually pressing save button 
3. Don't need save button for home location if going to have another save
4. BIG PROBLEM (if u set home location to something new, then move back 1 fragment, and set it back to old home location... it gets confuse and keeps setting it to both every other time)
5. BIG PROBLEM (if u set emergency to something new, then move back 1 fragment, and put a different emergency contact... it gets confuse and keeps setting it to both every other time)

Information:
1. Needs to get correct contacts
