_____________
First time launching (I unistall it, clear cache, etc):
1. mMap.setOnMarkerClickListener(this); //will crash first time installing it  and make phone vibrate nonstop

Nav Bar / Every Fragment:
1. Need to figure out how to fix dealing with fragments if user clicks back button and it goes to map

Events:
1. Need to validate that user pick a valid date (Like today is 4/8/2020 and user pick 3/21/2020
2. Need a limit on name & description
3. this line is causing a lot of problems (e.g crashes app when creating events, won't let me view events after creating it, won't let me press back on invite guest) (obj.put("invited_users", getInvitedUsers(element.child("invited_users").getValue().toString()));)

Notification:
1. Needs to be able to see and accept/reject invited events and friend request

Maps:
1. Need a way to find destination

DangerZone:
1. Need to hide Datasnapshot output when clicking on marker ex: (Datasnapshot = { key = zone_name, value =....}
2. Need to validate that user gave a name
3. Need a light color variant of the dangerzone button when user changes to dark mode
4. Need to figure out how to delete old markers

Contacts:
1. Needs to show who is their current friends (not sure if it works)

Settings:	
1. Change buttons

User Account:										
1. Clicking top left yellow button will send user to map activity instead of setting page
2. Changing home location will save before actually pressing save button 
3. Have save home location and emergency contact save only after they click the 1 save
4. Save button shows loading dialog even though if there were no changes


Information:
1. Needs to get correct contacts
